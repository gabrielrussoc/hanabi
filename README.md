## Build from scratch

To build and run this from scratch:
1. Install node and npm (this was tested with v15.4.0 but probaby works with more). Using NVM is a good way to do this.
2. Go to `interface/` and run `npm install && npm build`
3. On one terminal screen, go to `server/` and run `npm install && npm start`.
4. On the other, go to `client/` and run `npm install && npm start`.
5. You can use incognito mode on `localhost:3000` to use additional players.
